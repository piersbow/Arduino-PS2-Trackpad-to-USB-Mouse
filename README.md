# Arduino-PS2-Trackpad-to-USB-Mouse

This was designed for installing the touchpad from the x260 thinkpad into an x230 or x220 (or really anything)

It is designed to have an arduino connected to the ps2 connection of the new touchpad, and then acts as a driver, converting the data into mosue movements.

Here is a guide of how to solder/install the touchpad https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dngqbaoxT89khAkPG6zRgaUaj4fg0lc7/view?usp=sharing

And here's a video of it working, https://youtu.be/LijNsT1gm6c
